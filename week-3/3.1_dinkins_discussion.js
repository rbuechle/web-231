//Side note- When you do your header each week you want to make sure to change the assignment and date and description. I've been forgetting as well. ( I made the correction so you can see how it should look)

//2. you had an extra circle bracket after 32

//also, for formatting consistency and to help prevent errors in your code you should use ; after each line in a code block.
