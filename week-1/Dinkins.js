var d; //This is variable "D"

var house; //This is variable "house"

var v12; //This is variable "v12"


//Line 3 (var house declaration) contained the starting syntax for a multi-line comment (/*) which causes the rest of the code to be interpreted as a comment. /* removed.

//Line 5 (var v12 declaration) incorrectly named the variable "12" instead of the intended "v12" as indicated by the comment. Variable name changed to v12.
